Chapter 7: Sample Explorer
==========================

Sample Explorer lets you search for tissue and blood samples of interest
so that you can learn more about the samples.

The Sample Explorer window has two panes:

-  **Right pane**

Lets you initiate a search for samples using one or more pre-defined
filters. For information, see *Select a Primary Search Filter*, next.

After you initiate a search, the pre-defined filters are replaced by
search results. For information, see *View and Refine Sample Search
Results* on page 100.

-  **Left pane**

Reflects the currently selected filters and the number of a filter’s
samples that appear in the search results.

Select a Primary Search Filter
------------------------------

This pane of the Sample Explorer window lets you initiate a search for
samples by selecting the primary search filter. The primary search
filters appear when you first open Sample Explorer, or, after you have
begun a search, when you click **Clear Search** in the upper-left corner
of the pane.

Click a filter to initiate a sample search.

Note that the number of samples that are associated with a filter appear
in parentheses after the filter name.

View and Refine Sample Search Results
-------------------------------------

After you select a `*primary search filter* <#_Select_a_Primary>`__:

-  The right pane displays the search results.

-  The left pane contains all selected and de-selected search filters,
   allowing you to narrow the search results.

The following figure illustrates the sections of the Sample Explorer
after a primary search filter has been selected:

Tasks you can perform in the Sample Explorer window include:

-  `*Select and remove search filters* <#_Select_and_Remove>`__

-  `*Sort and group the search results, and add/remove search result
   columns* <#_Manage_the_Search>`__

Select and Remove Search Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can refine a sample search result by adding and removing search
filters, including the primary filter you initially selected. Search
filters are listed in the left pane of the Sample Explorer window.

To select or remove a search filter, check or clear the check box next
to the filter name.

.. note::
    Clicking a filter name rather than the check box next to the name 
    will select that filter and deselect all currently selected filters.   

The filters you select are joined together in a search string by the
logical operators AND and OR, as follows:

-  Filters within a filter category (such as DataType) are joined by OR.

-  Filters in different filter categories are joined by AND.

   For example, the search string for the filter selections illustrated
   below is:

   (RBM OR Gene Expression) AND (Colorectal Cancer OR Gastric Cancer)
